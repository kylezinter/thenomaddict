			Boston is one of America's oldest cities, steeped in Revolution history and a rich sporting tradition (Titletown USA anyone?). Yet despite its age, the city is occupied by the young, playing host to over 100 colleges and universities. The result is a wealth of sites, restaurants, and bars geared for the budget-conscious student and young professional-a perfect locale for the modern nomad. If your travels leave you in Boston for a day or two, here are some good ways to explore and enjoy the Bean on the cheap.

				<strong>Fenway Park is baseball's iconic stadium,</strong> but prices reflect that. If you have to get in the stadium, scalp standing room tickets for around $25 and work your way down. But the real move is grabbing a window seat at the Bleacher Bar on Landsdowne Street. No need for a ticket, grab a burger and a beer and stare out the garage-sized window, located directly in center field, all for under $20.
			</p>
			<p class="tourP">
				<strong>The best way to see the city is on bike,</strong> but for travelers passing through this might be tough. Try the Hubway. Rent bikes and ride down the Charles River, check out the Boston skyline and rowers on the water as you relive B-roll from every Boston movie ever made (how you like dem apples?). The rates are super reasonable, but keep your eye on the clock. Either way, beats a duck tour.
			</p>
			<p class="tourP">
				<strong>When hunger pangs kick in</strong> Bangkok City Restaurant on Massachusetts Ave. has you covered. Grab the best chicken pad thai in the city for under $10 with enough food to last you two meals. Don't let the creepy military portraits and orchestral Disney cover songs fool you, this place is legit.
			</p>
			<p class="tourP">
				<strong>Everybody loves Happy Hour,</strong> except Boston legislature, who banned the drink discounting in 1984. Still, if you want a cheap drink in Boston, head to Jose McIntyre's near Faneuil Hall for $2.50 personal pitchers (about 2.5 pints). Not the cleanest spot, but if the goal is libations, Jose Mac's is a good start. (It also moonlights as a dance bar and is one of the only downtown spots not to charge a cover.)
			</p>
			<p class="tourP">
				<strong>If throbbing music isn't on the agenda,</strong> it's all about dinner and pool at Tasty Burger. Starving Student Special will get you a burger, fries, and beer for $10 at this converted auto garage near Fenway. Stick around, watch a game, and enjoy the only free pool table in the area.
			</p>
			<p class="tourP">
				<strong>Get your dose of history,</strong> and hit up the Bunker Hill Memorial in Charlestown. Climb to the top of the obelisk (it's free), and take in the 360 views as you imagine thousands of angry red coats charging your position. If you keep your views and history separate, the Top of the Hub in the Prudential Center is the best view in Boston. Don't feel pressured to buy anything, the views are free, and best after a fresh coat of snow.
			</p>
			<p class="tourP">
				<strong>Rest your head</strong> at the H.I. Boston Downtown, a youth hostel with free Wi-Fi, bathroom access, and breakfast right near Boylston Street and the Prudential Center. Dorm-style rooms will run you just $34 a night.
			</p>
			<p class="tourP">
				<strong>For the culture-cravers,</strong> the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston is one of the largest in the nation and offers free admission with a student ID from over 40 area colleges. Who said that education could never pay off?
